# Multi-Vendor-Marketplace
 A Multi-Vendor Marketplace is an online platform that allows multiple independent vendors or sellers to list and sell their products or services. These marketplaces function as a centralized hub where customers can browse products from different sellers, compare offerings, and make purchases in a single transaction.
